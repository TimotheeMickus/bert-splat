# Github repo for "How To Dissect a Muppet"

This is the repository for "How to Dissect a Muppet: The Structure of
Transformer Embedding Spaces", to appear in TACL.

**Note:** the code here is not user-friendly. You're welcome to rework on it on
your own, we're only distirbuting it for future reference and reproductibility.

## How is this repository structured?
The main bit is to be found in `linear_structure.py`;  that's where we decompose
embeddings in sub-terms and define some other useful tools.

The remaining scripts correspond to different (sub-)experiments.
